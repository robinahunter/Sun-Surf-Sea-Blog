## SUN SURF SEA: MEN-Stack CRUD App

Sun Surf Sea is a full stack application built from scratch using MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, NodeJS, EJS and CSS.

The project is a responsive application designed for a blog website. The website showcases a selection of blog titles and includes a prominent featured section. An engaging introduction informs visitors about the purpose of their visit.

Within the application, users have the ability to search for and sort the available blogs using a sort feature. When a user clicks on a blog title, they are redirected to a dedicated detail page where they can access the complete content of the blog. Additionally, they can leave a review of the blog and post new blogs.
